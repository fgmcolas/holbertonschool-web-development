## HTML Structure Implementation Project
### Project Overview

Welcome to the HTML Structure Implementation project! In this project, you'll be focusing on creating a webpage's HTML structure based on a designer file provided in Figma. The objective is to practice writing clean, semantic HTML without any CSS or styling. This is the first step in a series of projects aimed at building a complete webpage from scratch.

## Objectives

1. Implement HTML Structure: Create a well-structured HTML document that mirrors the design provided in Figma.
2. Focus on Semantics: Use appropriate HTML5 semantic tags to ensure the structure is meaningful and accessible.
3. Prepare for Styling: Set a strong foundation that can be easily styled in future projects.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

Basic understanding of HTML5.

Familiarity with Figma (helpful, but not required).

Figma account to access the design file.

### Accessing the Design File

Figma Link: Page in Figma
Duplicate to Drafts: Click on "Duplicate to your Drafts" in Figma to have full access to the design details.

### Fonts

Source Sans Pro: If the fonts are missing, you can download Source Sans Pro here.
Spin Cycle OT: Download Spin Cycle OT here.

## Instructions

1. Analyze the Design: Study the Figma design to understand the structure and components of the webpage.
2. Create the HTML File: Start by setting up a new HTML file (index.html).
3. Implement the Structure:
Use semantic HTML5 elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.

Ensure that all content from the design is included and correctly nested within appropriate tags.

Test the Structure: Open the HTML file in a browser to ensure that all elements are correctly placed and accessible.

## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of what your HTML structure might look like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Webpage Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Website Header</h1>
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section id="section1">
            <h2>Section 1</h2>
            <p>This is the first section of the webpage.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="section2">
            <h2>Section 2</h2>
            <p>This is the second section of the webpage.</p>
        </section>
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>Website Footer</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

## Tips

Semantics Matter: Choose the right tags for the right content. This not only helps with SEO but also improves accessibility.

Consistent Structure: Keep your HTML structure consistent with the design to make future styling easier.

Validate Your HTML: Use tools like the W3C Markup Validation Service to ensure your HTML is error-free.

## Conclusion

This project is designed to enhance your HTML skills and prepare you for more complex web development tasks. Focus on creating a solid, semantic structure, and enjoy the process of turning a design into a functional webpage!
